# ECommerceStore

Hi I used up the 3 hours on the task. Admittedly didn't get as much done as I wanted. Mid way through the implmentation I realised I was trying to implement too much. I've got a basic version of what you wanted hosted on GH. I also have a text file I used for making a rough plan of how I was going to do this before actually coding which I've included in this repo. I'd love to discuss further what I wanted to do, what I didn't have time to fix, and why I did things the way I did. I look forward to speaking with you.

Bill ;)
